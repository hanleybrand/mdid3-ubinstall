This is a simple project, to make shell scripts to simplify the installation
of MDID3 on a Lucid Lynx VM for the purpose of doing development, testing MDID3, 
etc. 

I guess you could also use it to set up a production server, but that's 
your decision. 

This should be very exciting for you, because I am neither a qualified ubuntu
sysadmin, nor do I have any experience writing installer programs. 

So, enjoy!  :-)
